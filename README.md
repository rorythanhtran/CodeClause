# CodeClause
This repository highlights my work on real-world problems, including two projects I completed over the course of one month. 
As a Data Science Intern at CodeClause, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, and project development. It provided me an opportunity to sharpen my skills in data preprocessing and  algorithm implementation.
