# CodeClause
This repository showcases my work at CodeClause, including two projects I completed over the course of one month. 
As a Data Science Intern at CodeClause, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, and project development. It provided me an opportunity to apply in-class knowledge and sharpen my skills.
