## **About the Python Project**
This project creates a Python-based application that classifies the **gender** and **age group** of individuals from facial images. The application works as follows:

- **Dataset:** The project uses a pre-trained model trained on datasets like UTKFace and IMDB-WIKI, which contain labeled facial images for gender and age classification.
- **Classification:** The program processes detected faces to classify gender (Male/Female) and age group (e.g., 0–10, 11–20, etc.).
- **Interactive Interface:** Users can load an image or use a webcam to classify faces in real time, with the results displayed directly on the detected faces.

## **The Dataset**
- **Source:** UTKFace or IMDB-WIKI Dataset
- **Details:**
  - Includes thousands of labeled facial images.
  - Provides accurate gender and age labels across diverse demographics.

## **Libraries Used**
The following Python libraries are used:
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
